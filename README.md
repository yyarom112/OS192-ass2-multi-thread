# OS192-ass2-multi-thread

The assignment main goal is to teach you about synchronization mechanisms and XV6 process management.
First, you will implement a Kernel-level threads framework, which will enable the user to use multi-threading.
Next, you will implement in the kernel a simple synchronization primitive, the mutex, and using the mutex
you have added, you will implement a tournament based mutex for N processes in the user space. Lastly,
you will create a sanity test for the above implementations.
The assignment is composed of the following parts:
1. Implement the Kernel-level threads framework
2. Implement the mutex synchronization primitive in the kernel space.
3. Implement a tournament based mutex for N threads in the user space.
4. Create a sanity test for testing the above 3 implementations.
